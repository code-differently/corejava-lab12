# Return Ready Lab 12

* Part A - Foundations 5.1
* Part B - Foundations 5.2
* Part C - Instructor Challenge

## Part A

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab12.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example01_BooleanDemo` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab12.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity01_TempCheck` per the following:

        Create a program that takes in an expected user input as an integer
        The program should compare that input and based on the result of the comparison, print out a statement:
        If input is less than or equal to 45 - "It's cold - putting on a coat!"
        If input is greater than or equal to 46 and less than or equal to 65 - "It's not bad out - a hoodie will do just fine!"
        Any other situation, - "It's hot - a T shirt will be perfect."

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```
Enter a number from 0 to 100
66
It's hot - a T shirt will be perfect.
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab12.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example02_EqualityString` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab12.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity02_EqualityOperator` per the following:

    Create a program that compares two variables (4 and 5) and returns if they're equal to each other - true of false

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Are 4 and 4 equal? true
Are 4 and 5 equal? false
```

### Example and Activity 03

#### Step 01

In the package `lab12.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example03_EqualityTest` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab12.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity03_IfElseNameCheck` per the following:

    Create a program that asks the user for their first name and stores it
    Check the name the user input against Elvis - if it Elvis, print out "You are the king of rock and roll"
    After checking the name, if the user's name is anything aside from Elvis - "You are not the king"

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Enter your name:
Elvis
You are the king of rock and roll
```

### Example and Activity 04

#### Step 01

In the package `lab12.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example04_IfDemo` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab12.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity04_IfElseDemo` per the following:

    Create a program that takes a user input as a number
    Check the number, if it is equal to 7, the program should print to the user "That's lucky!"
    If after checking the number and it is not equal to 7, print to the user "That's unlucky!"

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Enter a number:
5
That's unlucky!
```

## Part B

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab12.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example01_ChainedIf` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab12.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity01_CheckGrades` per the following:

    Create a program that receives various grades from the user including: Math, Science, Geography, English, and Java
    Total the inputs and state what the total was in the five subjects
    Print out the average and call it a percentage per the sample below

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
What was your grade in Math?
80
What was your grade in Science?
75
What was your grade in Geography?
80
What was your grade in English?
75
What was your grade in Java?
80
Total grade in five subjects: 390.0
My percentage: 78.0
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab12.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example02_` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab11.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity02_Maximum` per the following:

    Create a program that has two numerical variables - x and y
    Assign a value of 20 to x
    Perform a logical ternary check that will assign 90 to y after checking whether the value of x is equal to 1
    Print out "value of y is: " + y
    Perform a second logical ternary check that will assign 61 to y after checking whether the value of x is equal to 20
    Print out "value of y is: " + y

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Value of y is: 90
Value of y is: 61
```
